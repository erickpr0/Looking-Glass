# Looking Glass: Cisco IOS configuration and tips.

Cisco IOS support is rather straightforward with IOS versions from the last
decade and afterwards.

## Security and user access

As security by least privilege is quite efficient, using a restricted user to
execute the commands is advised.

Of all methods to create a restricted user, we know of two methods to achieve
such setup:

  * Role Based CLI with Views [1][2] + access-class restriction
  * Privilege exec levels manipulation [3]

We highly recommand the first method, though we will document both.

## Configuration: Views method

Log in your Cisco router and then in enable mode, type the following commands:

```
router#enable view
Password:

router#config terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
router(config)#parser view looking-glass
router(config-view)# secret VIEW-ENABLE-PASSWORD
router(config-view)# commands exec include all traceroute
router(config-view)# commands exec include all ping
router(config-view)# commands exec include all show bgp
router(config-view)# commands exec include show
router(config-view)# exit
router(config)#access-list 1 permit IP4-ADDR-OF-YOUR-LOOKING-GLASS
router(config)#username lg view looking-glass access-class 1 secret LG-USER-PASSWORD
router(config)# end
router# write
```

SSH pubkey based authentication is preferred too:

```
router(config)#ip ssh pubkey-chain
router(conf-ssh-pubkey)#username lg
router(conf-ssh-pubkey-user)#key-string
router(conf-ssh-pubkey-data)#           ! Input the pubkey BUT WRAP TO ~ 80 CHARS BEFORE PASTING
router(conf-ssh-pubkey-data)# end
```

## Configuration: Privilege exec method

Not our preferred method, as it modifies the global behaviour of the Cisco
privilege system, but you may still prefer this methodâ€¦ or work with severely
outdated IOS :/

Log in your Cisco router and then in enable mode, type the following commands:

```
router#config terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
router(config)# privilege exec all level 4 show bgp
router(config)# privilege exec all level 4 ping
router(config)# privilege exec all level 4 traceroute
router(config)#access-list 1 permit IP4-ADDR-OF-YOUR-LOOKING-GLASS
router(config)#username lg privilege 4 access-class 1 secret LG-USER-PASSWORD
router(config)# end
router# write
```
Note that the privilege level used in this example is arbitrary.

DISCLAIMER: THIS METHOD WASN'T TESTED AND WON'T BE FOR THE MOMENT!

## Debug

Activate SSH Events logging:

```
router#config terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
router(config)#ip ssh logging events
router(config)# end
router#
```

Test the SSH/Telnet connection from the server where the looking glass is installed.

Display the resulting logs during your tests:

```
router# show logging
Aug  4 2014 01:45:03.012 CEST: %SSH-5-SSH2_USERAUTH: User 'lg' authentication for SSH2 Session from $IP4-ADDR-OF-LG (tty = 0) using crypto cipher 'aes128-ctr', hmac 'hmac-sha1-96' Succeeded
Aug  4 2014 01:45:05.104 CEST: %SSH-5-SSH2_CLOSE: SSH2 Session from $IP4-ADDR-OF-LG (tty = 0) for user 'lg' using crypto cipher 'aes128-ctr', hmac 'hmac-sha1-96' closed
```

When done, deactivate SSH Events logging:

```
router#config terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
router(config)#no ip ssh logging events
router(config)# end
router#
```
